## UNIT ILLUSTRATIONS

**Unit 01: Greetings (Selamat Pagi)**
> Kiki enthusiastically waving with both hands at an Indonesian person. Over-eager, slightly awkward. Person waves back amused. Sunny yellow sun in corner. Warm, welcoming.

**Unit 02: Numbers & Money (Berapa?)**
> Kiki with swirly confused eyes holding Rupiah with many zeros. Comically long receipt trails behind. Money floating. Bewildered by all the zeros.

**Unit 03: Food & Dining (Warung)**
> Kiki at food stall, face bright red, sweating, steam from ears after spicy sambal. Tongue out, fanning mouth. Nasi goreng and chili visible. Hilarious overreaction.

**Unit 04: Directions (Jalan-Jalan)**
> Kiki on a scooter, map completely upside down, confused. Road signs pointing everywhere. Helpful Gojek driver (in green) pointing the right way. Comedic lost situation.

**Unit 05: Time & Routine (Jam Berapa?)**
> Kiki in panic mode, running with alarm clock ringing. One sandal flying off. Fur messy like just woke up. Morning sun. Late! Comedic chaos.

**Unit 06: Family (Keluarga)**
> Kiki surrounded by big Indonesian family - grandma pinching cheeks, uncle patting head, kids hugging. Overwhelmed but happy, blushing. Hearts floating. Warm family chaos.

**Unit 07: Adjectives (Panas/Dingin)**
> Split image - LEFT: Kiki melting in heat, sweat puddle. RIGHT: Kiki freezing with icicles in AC. Extreme contrast, exaggerated reactions. Temperature comedy.

**Unit 08: Health (Sakit)**
> Kiki looking sick in blanket, thermometer in mouth, sad puppy eyes. Kind pharmacist offers medicine and coconut. Adorably dramatic sick face.

**Unit 09: Past & Future (Sudah/Belum)**
> Kiki in center with thought bubbles - LEFT: chaotic yesterday. RIGHT: bright tomorrow with stars. Determined and hopeful expression. Timeline feeling.

**Unit 10: Social Etiquette (Sopan Santun)**
> Kiki nervously removing tiny shoes at doorway, bowing too deep, almost tipping over. Host family smiling kindly. Shoes neatly placed. Sweet cultural learning moment.
