## Key Grammar Rules

1. **No "am/is/are"**
   - English: I **am** Budi.
   - Indonesian: *Saya Budi.* (I Budi.)

2. **Verbs never change** - just add time markers (sudah, belum, akan, etc.)

3. **Noun comes before Adjective**
   - English: Big house
   - Indonesian: *Rumah besar* (house big)

4. **"Belum" vs "Tidak"**
   - *Belum* = Not yet (polite, maybe later)
   - *Tidak* = No (strong, permanent)

5. **Say "very" in two ways:**
   - Formal: *Sangat* + adjective → *Sangat bagus* (Very good)
   - Casual: adjective + *banget* → *Bagus banget!* (So good!)
